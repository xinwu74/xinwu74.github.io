## Abstract
<br>

Multi-label chest X-ray (CXR) image classification aims to perform multiple disease label prediction tasks. This concept is more challenging than single-label classification problems. For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often struggle to capture the statistical dependencies between labels. Furthermore, the drawback of concatenating CNN and Transformer is the lack of direct interaction and information exchange between the two models...
