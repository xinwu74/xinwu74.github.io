📖 I am currently a PhD student 🔭. The main research directions of the master's degree are image processing, AI 💻 + medical 🏥, and the key research directions are imaging medicine and traditional Chinese medicine intelligent diagnosis. My current research interests lie in time series 📈, OOD Generalization, and reliable AI. I am committed to pushing the boundaries of these research areas and exploring the full potential of machine learning algorithms to contribute meaningfully to the world of technology.

🤔 Only two things make me move.

i. ⌨️ 🧱 Working with Attention. It's all I need.

ii. Life was like a box of chocolates 🍫. You never know what you're going to get.

iii. ❤️ I like running 🏃‍♀️, eating 🐮, traveling 🏝, and bicycling 🚴.
